# Algorithm

Implementation of algorithm obtained by the courses CMPUT204 and also other sources (Leetcode, etc.)
CMPUT204:
- Loop invariant
- Recurrence relation: Master's theorem
- Divide and Conquer: Exponentiation, multiplication of long intergers, Strassen's matrix multiplication, maximum subarray sum
- Data structures: AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree, Hash table
- Dynamic Programming: Rod cutting, 0-1 knapsack problems, matrix chain multiplication, longest common sequence, computing bionomial coeffcients
- Greedy algorithm: Fractional knapsack, task scheduling, activity selection
- Graph algorithm: BFS, DFS, DFS for trees/forest, Topological Sorting, Minimum Spanning Tree
