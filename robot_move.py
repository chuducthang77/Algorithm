#We have the map and the corresponding coordinates, we will have a block and we want to calculate
#the highest probability of the place we will go in and put the block there, note that we cannot 
#put the block at the final destination. Suppose we have probability go to the right is r(i, j) 
#and probability to go up is 1 - r(i, j)
#Runtime: O(n^2)
